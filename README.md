- The dashboard describes the rainfall distribution amongst various Indian states along its western coast. It provides an interactive way to learn more about rainfall patterns and the changes it has seen in the last century.
- The data was obtained from the India Meteorological Department records hosted on the [Open Government Data Platform India](https://data.gov.in/catalog/rainfall-india?page=1) website.

- The data in the [Sub_Divison_IMD_2017.csv](Sub_Division_IMD_2017.csv) is the monthly rainfall (in millimetres) recorded within a given sub-division during between 1901 and 2017.
- In order to get the data in a state-wise format, the data from the sub-divisions which make up the state were added up. For example, data for the state of Maharashtra and Goa was obtained by summing up the data from the Konkan & Goa, Madhya Maharashtra, Marathwada and Vidarbha sub-divisions.
